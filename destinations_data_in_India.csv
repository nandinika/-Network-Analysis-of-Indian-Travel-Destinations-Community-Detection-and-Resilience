solotravelIndia,Best strategy for booking in Mumbai and banglore.,"Yes, I'm a solo traveler. 

I am making my bookings for my stay in Mumbai. Going next month. It's going to be my longest stay in one Indian city. I found a good hotel deal online. And I was about to put in a pay-on-arrival reservation but I stopped. I wondered, is it smart to book the FULL 30 days in advance? At a hotel I never heard of, in a city I've never been? ü§î 

Price: I had good results making reservations in Nepal; saving 50% by booking in-person with cash. But I worry that such discounts might not exist here. I worry it might backfire; and, I'd end up paying 20% more, for example.

Quality: I also worry about getting screwed on a small detail that I didn't know would even be a problem. As far as, room quality, amenities or excessive noise pollution. When I look for hotels, I go for the ones with the most reviews and rating a 8/10 or better. And within my price range, of course.

My question is: 1) Would it be prudent to book the whole stay in advance? OR, book only a few days, to see if I like it? Then HOPE I can extend. And 2) ARE in-person cash reservations a good money saving strategy in India, in general? Or is it hit or miss?

( I've learned the hardway that many things like CashApp and Venmo don't work in South Asia. And when I try paying for things locally through PayPal, they've bounced back. Though I've called PP and they say everything's fine. I've also tried settling my outstanding charges at hotels but they don't take my MasterCards. So, I've reported to using cash for everything in the region.)

I've also looked at airBnBs... I'm at one now. And it sucks. To be honest, I haven't had a good Airbnb experience since the first and third time, 6 yrs ago. In Romania. I digress. ... Was considering Airbnb still because the last hotel I was at in Ch--um--Punjab State was really getting on my nerves. Calling me multiple times during the day for having a female visitor or two. Didn't know that was even a thing as long as they left before 5PM. 

Anyway, thanks in advance for your constructive, on-topic advice!",Check google Maps whether there are enough hotels in that price range in the region. If yes then book for a few days.

solotravelIndia,"Is it safe to travel in India as a solo female traveler. How likely is it that the police will help, vs make it worse?","I‚Äôve always had an immense interest in traveling to India, but reports of tourist rape / gang rapes worry me, especially as a previous victim (but in the US, by someone I knew.) I hear horror stories but also women saying they were fine. Obviously basic awareness and precautions are a must. Beyond that:

1) How safe would you say it is overall?

2) What particular cities are safe? I‚Äôve seen the same cities on lists of ‚ÄúMost Dangerous for Women‚Äù and ‚ÄúSafest for Women‚Äù.

3) What about self defense? Supposedly pepper spray and stun guns are legal. If used, am I likely to actually be prosecuted more strongly than the rapist themselves?

4) Leading into from the above question, are police more likely to help, dismiss, or even join in? 

5) Kind of dramatic, but if a rapist is murdered by a tourist in self defense, what would the consequences be?

I‚Äôve heard that India is no worse than Europe or the US, and that it‚Äôs media hype. But of the many female travelers I‚Äôve met, many, many more of them have had difficult / traumatic events in India than anywhere else in the world.
","Please don't. As an Indian, please don't. Our country is extremely unsafe, and is no place for a woman, let alone a solo female traveler. The recent case of the Spanish woman's rape in jharkhand state will tell you everything you need to know. 

If you still insist on traveling, I do recommend cities like Mumbai and Bangalore and maybe some southern Indian states like Kerala or Tamil Nadu. And I insist you travel in a group and stay in reputed four or five star hotels. Spending some money here will go a long way in keeping you safe. I'm ashamed of the evil in my nation and I do not want anyone to fall victim to it until things improve here. Stay safe and carefully consider your decisions, please.","Is it safe to travel in India as a solo female traveler. How likely is it that the police will help, vs make it worse? I‚Äôve always had an immense interest in traveling to India, but reports of tourist rape / gang rapes worry me, especially as a previous victim (but in the US, by someone I knew.) I hear horror stories but also women saying they were fine. Obviously basic awareness and precautions are a must. Beyond that:

1) How safe would you say it is overall?

2) What particular cities are safe? I‚Äôve seen the same cities on lists of ‚ÄúMost Dangerous for Women‚Äù and ‚ÄúSafest for Women‚Äù.

3) What about self defense? Supposedly pepper spray and stun guns are legal. If used, am I likely to actually be prosecuted more strongly than the rapist themselves?

4) Leading into from the above question, are police more likely to help, dismiss, or even join in? 

5) Kind of dramatic, but if a rapist is murdered by a tourist in self defense, what would the consequences be?

I‚Äôve heard that India is no worse than Europe or the US, and that it‚Äôs media hype. But of the many female travelers I‚Äôve met, many, many more of them have had difficult / traumatic events in India than anywhere else in the world.
 Please don't. As an Indian, please don't. Our country is extremely unsafe, and is no place for a woman, let alone a solo female traveler. The recent case of the Spanish woman's rape in jharkhand state will tell you everything you need to know. 

If you still insist on traveling, I do recommend cities like Mumbai and Bangalore and maybe some southern Indian states like Kerala or Tamil Nadu. And I insist you travel in a group and stay in reputed four or five star hotels. Spending some money here will go a long way in keeping you safe.

One of the highlights of my journey was the opportunity to meet incredible people, both locals and fellow solo travelers.

solotravelIndia,Tips for a complete noob!,"Hello, fellow Homo sapiens.

I'm a complete noob when it comes to solo travelling. Never did that before. Planning to do one this May. So I was hoping to get some pointers from more experienced people- place suggestions, what and what not to pack, mode of travel, mistakes you've made that you don't want others to make, tips on planning a trip etc.etc.

Just a few things about myself so that y'all can help me out better-

1. I'm a student and native of Kerala, studying there itself. Final year exams would be done by April. Wants to blow off some stream. Introvert and a lone wolf and hence never a part of any pack. So little hope of joining with friends.

2. Have travelled with friends- banglore, delhi and few one day trips. But never did a solo one. In these longs trips, mostly my friends had idea on where all to visit. So never was actively involved in hotel booking or deciding where to go.

3. Have licence and can drive scooters and lightweight bikes. Not the heavy ones like RE.

4. Since it's my first trip, suggestions regarding safe and south Indian places would be great. But North is not exempted. 

5. Complete teetotaller, doesn't smoke or use recreational stuff. 

So if you guys have any suggestions or tips to this dummy, please share!

- ride a camel and go glamping? 
- yoga
- eat some amazing vegetarian food

Go try and see the only Asiatic lions in the world in Sasan Gir and visit the Rann of Kutch (salt desert). Go North to Jaisalmer to see the sand dunes and head East to see the camel market in Pushkar. Visit Ranthambore National Park for tigers and the Taj Mahal is nearby. End in Dehli. Good vegetarian food is everywhere, and yoga should be too. Check out Vrindavan, South of Delhi, for a spiritual touch if you haven't found it already on the way. You can plot these places on a map and see that it's a pretty perfect route that includes everything you mentioned. | 2 weeks is a short time to cover such a large country, so I'd suggest you skip the trip to Kochi. Kerala is beautiful (I'm from there!) but you won't see many camels or get many vegetarian options as the state has the second highest non-veg population. Based on what you're looking for, I'd say Rajasthan is the best bet (and it's between Mumbai and Delhi too!)

It's got the camel filled dessert, insanely cool palaces, vibrant culture and a national park with many tigers. And amazing food!! Pushkar has a good hippie population, if you're into that.

TIA","Decathlon ftw \m/. You will get everything you need except for your food. 

I am not sure about permits, I always trek with IH. 

For tips on DIY trekking you can follow Indiahikes | Permits: I personally never came across a permit issue. Some places can be off limits. Permits might be needed form Wildlife/Forest dept in such cases. But mostly you're a free burd.

 Weather: Looking up weather forecast is definitely a good idea. April-September is a good window to explore the north. Unless you are planning snow treks. Then it's a different ball game.

Satellite phone: You have to accept that you will be off the grid. I haven't seen people carry satellite phones. Enjoy the DND zone.

Food: I don't know of many options. Pasta, Maggi, MTR ready to eat are some easy meals.You can also try tea and coffee mix if you're a beverage fan.

Trailmaps: I research trails aggressively on Google Earth and FatMap, remembering geographical landmarks on satellite maps. This always helps and adds to the fun. FatMaps also let you check the trail elevation. You can also keep satellite maps cached and use offline Google maps. 

Preparation: Physical readiness is key. YOU have to carry your backpack and yourself for the whole trek. You'll need stamina and strength.

Try packing light.This Gear should work for most treks:
Tent
Sleeping bag 
Backpack
Jacket/fleece
Trekking shoes
Sandals
Burner
Gas canister
Canteen
Water bottle
Lifestraw
Sunscreen
Cap/hat
Arm Sleeves
Towel
Power bank
Raincoat
Snacks
Wet tissue pack
Garbage bags

Happy Backpacking!","Preparation resources I‚Äôve seen some videos where backpackers hike up himachal, Uttarakhand,rishikesh etc.  solo.  Wondering how does one prepare?  Permits, weather, satellite phone, food, trail maps, etc.  how does one start the preparation?

TravelIndia,GO LIFE COMPANY: A BIG FRAUD TRAVEL SCAM,"

While we were near Palolem Beach, Goa, we were approached by representatives of a company called GO LIFE, offering a lucky coupon draw. My husband didn‚Äôt win, but I got a winning card with four options:  
a) Samsung Galaxy Phone  
b) 4 Nights & 3 Days Stay  
c) Smartwatch  
d) ‚Çπ15,000 Cash  

The representative excitedly said, Only a few people get this! My husband was skeptical and immediately said, If this is a scam, I‚Äôll report it to the police. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll only get the hotel stay.

The guy confidently replied, Sir, do you think a scam would happen inside a 4-5 star hotel SOBIT SAROVAR PORTICO, GOA you can even check this resort on Google Maps

This false sense of security led us into their trap.  


- How They Try to Convince You

Once inside the conference room, we were assigned to a so-called holiday consultant, who made small talk to analyze our travel habits and spending potential.  

They claimed that post-pandemic, they shifted from B2B to B2C and were now offering a special membership deal called as. Holiday ownership.

The catch? Sit through a 1-hour presentation and take a hotel tour.

During this, they brainwashed us, making it sound like we‚Äôd get 15 years of luxurious stays at 4/5-star hotels in India and abroad for a one-time payment of ‚Çπ1.5L, ‚Çπ2.5L, or ‚Çπ3.5L.  

When I asked, How do you profit by giving us free stays? they said, We buy hotel rooms in bulk during non-peak times, ensuring business for hotels.

It sounded convincing in a way they explained, but their so-called manager was unprofessional,, and their pushy sales tactics were a huge red flag.  


High-Pressure Tactics & The Escape

I was about to consider it, but my husband firmly said, Not required, we‚Äôll leave. I requested 2-3 days to think, but suddenly, their tone changed:  

‚ùå The biggest red flag was the pressure to make an immediate decision‚Äîwithin just 60 minutes‚Äîwithout giving us any time to think. 

‚ùåThey demanded that we pay upfront, right then and there. 

That‚Äôs when I lost my patience and confronted them. We walked out and immediately searched Reddit‚Äîand sure enough, there were many complaints about the same scam.  



These scams work by operating inside 5-star hotels to appear legitimate and luring people in with false promises.  

‚ö†Ô∏è No ‚Çπ70,000 hotel stay comes ‚Äúfree‚Äù with a ‚Çπ1.5L-‚Çπ2.5L package.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you‚Äôre asked to pay upfront for ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù travel deals‚Äîwalk away.
 
‚ö†Ô∏è Always research before committing to travel memberships.

TravelIndia,Visiting Bangalore for 2-3 Days ‚Äì Need Recommendations! (From Mumbai),"Hey folks! My two friends and I are visiting your amazing city this week for a short trip (2-3 days), and we‚Äôd love some recommendations to make the most of it. We‚Äôre from Mumbai and super excited to explore, but also a little unsure about how to get around and what not to miss!

Please help us out with  the best places to explore, eat, and shop and experience Bangalore... Also, is renting a car a good idea, or should we stick to Uber/Metro? Any solo recommendations for one free day? Thanks in advance!!

# ","Bangalore is a vibrant city that offers a great mix of green spaces, historic sites, and a dynamic culinary scene, making it an ideal destination for a short trip. Since you‚Äôre coming from Mumbai, you‚Äôll find that Bangalore has its own laid-back yet modern charm. 

For getting around, I‚Äôd recommend sticking to Uber, auto-rickshaws, or the Metro rather than renting a car, as traffic can be challenging and public transport is both convenient and affordable.

Start your mornings with a visit to Cubbon Park or Lalbagh Botanical Garden, where you can enjoy a refreshing walk amidst nature and even catch some beautiful photography opportunities. If you‚Äôre interested in history, Bangalore Palace offers a fascinating glimpse into the city‚Äôs regal past. And if you‚Äôre up for an early start, consider a sunrise trip to Nandi Hills‚Äîthis might require hiring a driver for the day, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it for the spectacular views.

When it comes to food, Bangalore has something for every taste. For breakfast, you can try iconic spots like CTR for a delicious benne masala dosa or MTR and Vidyarthi Bhavan if you don‚Äôt mind a little wait. For lunch or dinner, indulge in South Indian flavors at places like Nagarjuna or Brahmin‚Äôs Coffee Bar, and if you‚Äôre craving non-vegetarian dishes, don‚Äôt miss out on the famed donne biryani at Shivaji Military Hotel. Later in the day, you can explore the buzzing street food scene at VV Puram Food Street, where the variety of local delicacies truly shines.

For shopping and soaking up the local vibe, spend an evening on Church Street, Brigade Road and MG Road, which are bustling with shops, cafes, and vibrant street life. Commercial Street is also a must-visit if you‚Äôre looking to pick up souvenirs or enjoy some bargain shopping, while UB City offers a more upscale experience with high-end stores and fine dining. 

If you have a free day to explore on your own, wandering through the trendy neighborhoods of Indiranagar or Koramangala will give you a taste of Bangalore‚Äôs modern, cosmopolitan culture, along with plenty of cafes and boutique stores to discover.

Overall, Bangalore‚Äôs charm lies in its blend of tradition and modernity, and with these recommendations, you should be well-equipped to enjoy an immersive and memorable short trip.

We‚Äôre looking for luxury budget stays in Varkala‚Äîpreferably close to the beach, offering a peaceful and relaxing environment. Any recommendations?

Additionally, what are the best travel options between these destinations? We want a comfortable and scenic journey while exploring the region.

Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated!","For a romantic and relaxing trip to Varkala, Vagamon, and Alleppey, you‚Äôll find some excellent luxury budget stay options. 

In Varkala, consider Cliff Stories, Palm Tree Heritage, or Maadathil Cottages‚Äîall offering serene beachfront stays with great views and a peaceful atmosphere. 

If you prefer something slightly more upscale yet budget-friendly, Hindustan Beach Retreat provides a comfortable experience right by the beach with a pool and sea-facing rooms. Staying near Varkala Cliff will also give you easy access to charming cafes and sunset views.

For travel between these destinations, the best way to enjoy a scenic and comfortable journey is by hiring a private cab, as it allows you to explore en route. 

From Varkala to Vagamon (around 4‚Äì5 hours), a road trip via Kottayam offers lush landscapes, misty hills, and rubber plantations. 

From Vagamon to Alleppey (about 3 hours), the drive is equally picturesque, passing through tea estates and backwater regions. 

Alternatively, you can take a train from Varkala to Kottayam and then a cab to Vagamon, but direct road travel is more convenient. 

From Alleppey back to Varkala, a train is a good option for a relaxed and scenic ride.

For Alleppey, consider Lake Canopy, Lemon Tree Vembanad Lake Resort, or a luxury houseboat stay for a unique romantic experience. Spending a night on a well-reviewed private houseboat with good food and service can be an unforgettable experience.

Plan your stays in a way that allows you to unwind and soak in Kerala‚Äôs beauty at a leisurely pace.

For adventure & mountains ‚Äì Himachal (Kasol, Manali, Tirthan Valley) or Uttarakhand (Rishikesh for rafting, Auli for snow).

For offbeat beach vibes ‚Äì Gokarna (quieter, less commercialized than Goa) or Andaman (if budget allows).

TravelIndia,I want to plan a trip to jaipur for a few days from mid march to mid april,I want to plan a trip. Is this a good time to travel. How to commute and some good tips to shop. ,"

This is a fairly good time to visit Jaipur, though it starts getting warm to hot with temperatures ranging from 25¬∞C to 38¬∞C. Mornings and evenings are pleasant, but afternoons can be hot. It‚Äôs best to plan outdoor sightseeing in the morning and relax indoors during peak afternoon heat.

For commuting within the city, autos and e-rickshaws are great for short distances, but make sure to bargain before you ride. Uber and Ola are convenient for longer distances. City buses are affordable but can get crowded. You can also rent a scooter or bike if you‚Äôre comfortable navigating city traffic. If you prefer a hassle-free experience, hiring a private car with a driver is a comfortable option, especially for visiting places like Amber Fort.

When it comes to must-visit spots, the City Palace offers a deep dive into royal history with stunning architecture. Hawa Mahal is an iconic landmark, known as the ‚ÄúPalace of Winds.‚Äù Amber Fort is majestic, and you can enjoy an elephant ride or attend the light show in the evening. Jantar Mantar, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has fascinating astronomical instruments. For the best sunset view over the Pink City, head to Nahargarh Fort.

Shopping in Jaipur is an experience in itself. Johari Bazaar is the place to go for jewelry, including gold, silver, and gems. Bapu Bazaar is popular for mojaris (Jaipuri footwear), textiles, and leather products. Tripolia Bazaar is known for lac bangles and traditional Rajasthani wear. Chandpole Bazaar is perfect for handicrafts and marble items. When shopping, always bargain hard; start by offering half the quoted price. Carry cash, as many small shops prefer it. Some popular items to buy include block-printed fabrics, blue pottery, silver jewelry, and Jaipuri quilts.

For food, you must try Laxmi Mishthan Bhandar (LMB) for their Ghewar and Kachori. Rawat is famous for Pyaz Kachori and Mawa Kachori. For an authentic Rajasthani cultural experience with dinner, visit Chokhi Dhani. If you‚Äôre a non-vegetarian, Handi is well-known for its Laal Maas (spicy mutton curry).

Lastly, a few practical tips: stay hydrated and always carry a water bottle. Sunscreen and a hat are essential for sightseeing under the sun. It‚Äôs also a good idea to book your hotels in advance, as tourist spots can still get busy.

TravelIndia,Recommendations please,"I will be 19/20 weeks pregnant when I want to travel to a destination within India that is easy to go to that is; less road travel and more approachable. I stay in Hyderabad and 1 option I have is Munnar since my in-laws are in Kochi so I can go on a small detour for 2-3 days. 

Any suggestions? Given my condition I don‚Äôt want to do anything adventurous just a few days of relaxation.

Since you‚Äôre looking for a relaxing getaway with minimal road travel and pleasant weather in late March, Munnar is a good choice, but the road from Kochi to Munnar involves a winding uphill drive of about 4‚Äì5 hours, which might not be ideal during pregnancy.

Here are a few alternative destinations that are easier to reach and offer a peaceful retreat:

1. Kumarakom, Kerala ‚Äì If you‚Äôre open to a backwater retreat, Kumarakom is just a short drive (around 1.5 hours) from Kochi. You can stay in a lakefront resort, enjoy houseboat rides, and soak in serene views without much physical exertion.

2. Ooty, Tamil Nadu ‚Äì You can take a direct flight from Hyderabad to Coimbatore, followed by a relatively smoother 3-hour drive to Ooty. The weather will be cool, and you can relax at a scenic resort without needing to explore too much.

3. Coonoor, Tamil Nadu ‚Äì A quieter alternative to Ooty, Coonoor is just 1 hour from Coimbatore and offers stunning tea gardens, heritage stays, and a laid-back vibe.

4. Wayanad, Kerala ‚Äì Accessible via a short flight to Kozhikode (Calicut), followed by a 2.5-hour drive, Wayanad offers lush greenery, cool weather, and tranquil resorts.

If you‚Äôre set on Munnar, consider breaking the journey by spending a night in Kochi before heading uphill. Also, check with your doctor about travel precautions at 19‚Äì20 weeks.

Hope this helps, and wishing you a smooth and enjoyable trip! | These are great options.

Stop, observe, talk and repeat.

### Eat all you want

###### Kasol Tosh Kheerganga

The **Kasol-Tosh-Kheerganga circuit** is a perfect trek to take for beginners and experts alike. Positioned in the middle of the majestic Parvati mountains, the villages of Kasol, Tosh, and Kheerganga are every mountain lover‚Äôs paradise. This region is especially recommended for beginners because of the small treks that can be undertaken within the area. It is famous for its dense pine forests, luscious waterfalls, natural hot water springs and serene and polite village folk. The local cuisine is a delicious fusion of Himachali and Israeli cuisine, bound to tingle your senses. The Hosteller provides an all equipment inclusive trek of the entire circuit; which means that basically, all you have to carry is your ID, clothes and some cash.

**Region:** Parvati Valley.

**Duration:**¬†3 nights ‚Äì 4 days.

**Highest Altitude:**¬†\~10,000 feet.

**Avg. Temperature:**¬†12¬∞C.

###### Grahan Village

Not many are privy to the excellently hidden treasure that the quaint little hamlet of Grahan is. Located en route to the popular Sar Pass trek, this town holds just about 350 residents in 30 to 40 houses. The village is extremely picturesque and looks like it has been lifted from a movie. Most of the trail to Grahan is marked with neon arrow signs, courtesy of the locals and homestay owners of the area. The entire trail is packed with wooden bridges, gurgling rivulets and dense pine forests. This makes for a perfect path to follow. Whether you are posing for pictures on top of a fallen tree trunk or chilling with a warm cup of tea; this trek will not have a single boring moment. Travelling with the Hosteller will ensure that you see all of the local attractions too.

**Region:**¬†Parvati Valley.

**Duration:**¬†2 nights ‚Äì 3 days.

**Highest Altitude:**¬†\~7700 feet.

**Avg. Temperature:**¬†12¬∞C.

###### Bhrigu Lake

The Bhrigu Lake trek is easily one of the most gorgeous and alluring treks available in the entire country. Approachable from the city of Manali, this trek reaches an astonishing height. Legend says that the lake never fully freezes over because of a praying sage‚Äôs blessings. Glittery green virgin forests and scenic views of a plethora of mountains and peaks make this trek practically unforgettable. Characterised as a high altitude alpine meadow, the Bhrigu trek also lets you experience the Beas Kund valley, hot sulfur springs of Vashist and the vast grazing grounds of Rola Khuli. Book a place in the earliest available batch to ensure you don‚Äôt miss out on this beauty.

**Region:** Kullu Valley.

**Duration:**¬†3 nights ‚Äì 4 days.

**Highest Altitude:** \~14,000 feet.

**Avg. Temperature:**¬†8¬∞C.

###### Triund

The Triund trek is one of most popular lower Himalaya trails. Every year, hundreds of tourists (local and foreign alike) throng to experience this. Falling in the mighty Dhauladhar ranges, this trek starts from the pretty town of Mcleodganj. Mcleodganj is particularly well known for being Dalai Lama‚Äôs home away from home. The Triund trek is a comparatively smaller trekking route, spanning only a maximum time of 4 hours. The last 1 kilometer of the trek is the only moderately difficult area, known as the 22 curve points. Which is pretty much self-explanatory. But the Hosteller collaborates with expert guides who have been traversing these mountains ranges since years. They are more than capable of ensuring that you have a safe yet very thrilling trek.

**Region:**¬† Dhauladhar Ranges

**Duration:**¬†2 nights ‚Äì 3 days.

**Highest Altitude:**¬†9350 feet

**Avg. Temperature:**¬†12¬∞C

###### Kareri Lake

Located 9 km away from the town of Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, the Kareri Lake trek is one of the most highly rated offbeat locations for enthusiastic travellers. One of the best things about this lake is probably the high reflectivity of the icy blue waters. This makes for the most spectacular photo ops. The lake serves sometimes as a base for more explorative trails into the Dhauladhar range. Notably the Chamba and Bharmour. It is essentially a natural shallow lake and there are 2 temples overlooking it. The serene nature of the destination and the mind-blowing views of the entire trail, make Kareri Lake one of the Hosteller‚Äôs most offbeat and unique trekking locations. One should definitely add Kareri lake trek on their travel bucket list.

**Region:** Dhauladhar Ranges.

**Duration:**¬†3 nights ‚Äì 4 days.

**Highest Altitude:**¬†\~10,000 feet

**Avg. Temperature:**¬†18¬∞C

**So let's start with the obvious, how to get to your stays when you arrive. First, arriving by flight:**

Most travellers arrive in Goa via flight. We've got two airports, GOX and GOI. GOX is in the north of the state located in Mopa, GOI in the south in Vasco / Dabolim.

In general, once you arrive at either of the airports, you've got one of four options to pick for your travel to your stays:

1. Public transport via bus
2. Taxis at the airport
3. Taxis pre-booked through your hotel / contact at your stays
4. Taxis booked via GoaMiles

  
***Tip Number 1: As much as you can, aim to arrive during daylight hours.*** 

You're not going to find a bus for travel from either airport later in the evening or at night.¬† In general, we've got either the goverment entity Kadamba service or private buses operating from the airports, but expect the last bus to depart the airport around 18:00 to 19:00, irrespective of your destination. And bear in mind, you'll probably have to make connections via hubs.

The Kadamba (KTCL) bus timings can be found at [This Page for GOI](https://ktclgoa.com/category/dabolim-bus-timings/) and [This Page for GOX](https://ktclgoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/MOPA-EV-time-table-april-2022.jpeg)

Beyond these timings, your only options are taxis.

  
***Tip Number 2: If you do need to use the taxis, try to book them via GoaMiles or ask your hotel or host (from your stay) to get you a contact. And use the GoaMiles app for an estimate of a cost, but bear in mind, it will be the cheapest option so other options will be slightly costlier.***

If you do need to use a taxi, or if you wish to, try to follow this tip. GoaMiles is official and you will not get scammed whatsoever. Pre-book a taxi if you wish as well. Main reasons being, the airport taxis can be notorious at overcharging you, and if you're arriving at night, you may be charged more for ""night charges"".¬† And also, you might find yourself having to deal with Taxi Mafia if you're going to rely on airport taxis.  


**TOURIST TRAP 1: TAXI MAFIAS.**  
***The so called ""taxi mafia"" are easy to identify.*** These guys will probably find you at the arrivals exits, and will usually direct you towards the parking areas, which is where they park, or they will tell you that they're ""calling a car"". The reason the latter is common is because these owners sometimes don't park at the airport due to parking charges.

Best to avoid this situation by having a local contact given to you by your host or by asking your hotel to book you one, or booking your taxi via the GoaMiles App. In these cases, the cabs do not go around to the airport parking areas but will pick you up from the arrivals short-stay area (particularly at GOX), where you're going to face less obstruction from the taxi mafia. You can also book using the GoaMiles stands, but you may face some obstruction.

Note: GoaMiles is also more active at GOI as there's less disruption of the taxi mafia in the south.



**What if you don't arrive by flight?**

Travellers who don't arrive by flight, usually arrive by rail. The biggest rail hub in Goa is Madgaon Junction (in Margao/Madgaon). Travelling from here is similar. You ideally want to catch a bus from the station to Margao Bus Stand, and then make your way forward by connections through other hubs.

  
***Tip Number 3: If you arrive at Madgaon Junction, take the bus again, and once again aim to arrive during daylight hours.*** 

Same reasons as above, bus timings only usually go up to 19:00.

**Note:** The alternative rail stations to arrive include Vasco da Gama and Thivim, but the same tip applies. Bus connections exist, but only during daylight hours up to 19:00. beyond that follow Tip Number 2 for cabs. The only difference being you'll also have the option of autos.



**Bus Hubs and Connections:**

Depending on where you arrive, your main bus hubs will be Mapusa, Panaji, vasco and Margao.

You have KTCL shuttle services (non-stop / direct) between the following:

* Mapusa - Panaji
* Panaji - Margao
* Panaji - Vasco
* Vasco - Margao

***Tip Number 4: Get to one of these hubs, whichever is closest to your destination for your stay, and you WILL find a bus or connection going to that location. Again, buses only operate during daylight hours, last one departing at 19:00 or so****.*



**About your stays:**

Depending on your preference, you'll want to stay at hotels or looking at AirBnbs. But you also have the options of local guest houses and hostels. The guesthouses will be your cheapest options, and will be owned by true locals. You're way less likely to get scammed that way.

  
***Tip Number 5: Use local guest houses for stays. You can usually find these through AirBnb as well, or by a local contact. (Some even go as cheap as 1k a night or less)****.* 

The location of your stay is entirely up to you. You have cheap options all over, but you have to look, based on your preference. AirBnb and [Booking.com](http://booking.com) are the best for this. MakeMyTrip, not so much.

**Note: While most people prefer hotels, these are not owned by Goans and will generally be more expensive or overcharge.**

  
***Tip Number 6 (SUPER IMPORTANT): As much as you can, DO NOT arrive without having a stay booked.***

I have encountered MANY visitors come down with no idea of where they're going to stay. They wish to stay at ""popular locations"" such as Calangute and Baga, but have nothing booked. You're never going to find a last minute off the riff stay if you arrive that way, and you WILL get scammed.

There are only a few internationals who know how to properly navigate this approach as they get information of guest houses by word of mouth, but if you don't, you'll fall into another trap.

  
**TOURIST TRAP 2: COMMERCIAL STAYS AT POPULAR LOCATIONS.**  
**If you do arrive and you have no place booked, you better have word of mouth or contact with a local owning a guest house. Or else you will get the deals which are ""last minute charges""**.



**Exploring Goa:**

To each their own, but make an itinerary. While it is really nice to visit popular spots, I would definitely advise AGAINST indulging in services at these locations. For instance, you may want to visit Calangute or Baga beach, but as these places have been made popular by influences and internet reviews, they have also attracted immigrant businesses and money-grabbing tourist traps. And these are NEVER owned by locals.

  
***Tip Number 7: Avoid super commercial-looking businesses at popular locations, even if you don't want to avoid visiting the locations themselves.***

Avoid the commercial looking businesses at popular locations at all costs. Instead, visit alternate locations for local shacks, or water sports even. You'll not only get more local authenticity, but also cheaper rates from honest locals who would rather give you a good experience. I will not post any of these locations here, as we don't want them becoming the next Calangute or Baga, so it's up to you to do the digging.

  
**TOURIST TRAP 3: COMMERCIAL-LOOKING BUSINESSES AT POPULAR LOCATIONS.**  
**Due to the rise of internet reviews and influences, popular locations have attracted outside / immigrant businesses that overcharge and do not deliver authenticity. These apply to restaurants disguised as local shacks, watersports or even certain stalls. And local Goans DO NOT care about experiences at these locations as they do not own them. They will stay away to avoid conflict.**

**Do some digging to find alternatives at non-popular locations, and DO NOT publicly make them popular.** 

  
***Tip Number 8: Rent a bike for navigating Goa.***

These are super useful. Not only are they super cheap, but will also help you avoid hassles in parking or another other road-related issues.

BEWARE OF SCAMS AND TRAPS THOUGH.  


**TOURIST TRAP 4: SCAMMY BIKE OR CAR RENTALS.**  
**There are some bike or car rental businesses that may charge you for accidental damage or wear. Take photographs of the bike / car when you receive it, and when you drop it off, BEFORE YOU HAND OVER THE KEYS. Some scammers are known to scratch the vehicle with the keys as you go to sign off the return paperwork.**

  
***Tip Number 9: Find local eateries for authenticity****.*

There are numerous posts on r/goatravel¬† about finding authentic local eateries, pubs, bakeries and cafes. Find these and try out the local delicacies. Most local goan eateries have the absolute cheapest rates (even a full meal with dessert and a drink at under 500 INR). You can follow local YouTubers too. For instance, [Moses](https://www.youtube.com/@MosesJSaldanha) is one of the best.

*(Honestly, I don't need to tell you to be street smart, just do some research...)*

  
**Best times to visit Goa:**

Again, to each their own. However, there are a few peak times for tourism. The tourism season in Goa goes on between November and February / March. These months will offer you the most frequency in tourism activities. 

Irrespective of where you visit in Goa, costs WILL go up during December - January for the Christmas period. It doesn't do well that Sunburn and other music festivals / events usually take place at this time either, as there is a larger influx of tourists, thereby also driving up costs further. 

If you're travelling merely for a holiday, avoid visiting during the Christmas season and stick to the extremeties of the peak tourism season. 

The summer will also be super hot and you're less likely to find tourism acitvities if this is what you prefer.



**Behaving in Goa:**

I cannot believe this is a section I am including, but I have to since a lot of complaints have been raised about conflict.

***Here are some super important tips about avoiding conflict in Goa:***

***1. Follow driving rules.***  
I mean, I have personally encountered instances such as visitors driving on the wrong side of the street, overtaking, overspeeding and so on. While even some Goans indulge in this absolute idiocy, most Goans are not going to be tolerant of this. Goa in general is very intolerant to reckless driving.

***2. Park away from local communities and beaches.***  
FFS do not take your cars onto the sand or even remotely close to beaches or communities away from main roads. Locals generally dislike when the calm atmosphere is disrupted, mainly out of fear that the area will turn super popular, chaotic and violent. So the fear makes them want to retaliate. Also, beaches are not a place to drive. Sand dune ecosystems in Goa are under severe threat of damage, and unfortunately, one of the major causes is irresponsibly tourists.

***3. DO NOT stereotype Goa or Goans, and DO NOT visit with that mindset. Oh and also DO NOT liken Goa to portrayals in Bollywood.***  
Goa is and has always been a mixture of culture, tradition and authenticity. Unfortunately, many visitors, particularly domestic Indian visitors have stereotyped Goa as a ""party place"", ""honeymoon destination"" or ""clich√© holiday destination"". It is neither of those.   
  
It's a calm getaway destination to relax, mingle with local cultures and have an experience, and a lot of Goans appreciate this more. Even the clubs and partying scene has only increased due to domestic tourism demand. Fun fact, Calangute now has 400 or so bars, whereas back even 5-10 years ago that number was probably around 20-30.  
  
Most international tourists couldn't care less about this, and in many instances, that's why it appears that Goans prefer them. It isn't the money. International tourists spend less than domestic tourists do.

***4. DO NOT make Goa what it isn't.***  
When you come to Goa, experience it for what it is, without trying to make it what it isn't. Sure, preferences are one thing, but do not expect your own hometown to be brought here. Again unfortunately directed at domestic Indian visitors, there are way too many instances where conflict has occurred when non-Goans have tried to make Goa what it isn't, as it causes a visible decline in local tradition. Also, if you choose to visit an establishment that isn't obviously Goan but claims to have Goan foods, chances are you'll get scammed.

***5. Interact with locals properly.***  
Every single local in Goa will be happy to have a conversation with you, and will give you further tips to enjoy your stay. If you stay at a local guesthouse, some locals might even ask you what rates you're looking at paying, and then negotiate. DO NOT take advantage of them. The minute you try and blow smoke up someone's ass, or you try to gaslight or take advantage of a local, you WILL be asked to leave the premises, and chances are if the group includes immigrants supporting the locals, there will be conflict.

***6. FFS pick up your trash.***  
**Self-explanatory.**

***7. DO NOT invade privacy, stare or ogle****.*  
**SELF-FUCKING-EXPLANATORY.**



I think I've said enough. Feel free to DM or comment for specific tips. Or follow [Moses](https://www.youtube.com/@MosesJSaldanha).   
  
I'm also more than happy to help out with a specific itinerary, but I will heavily reluctant to post all of those here to maintain privacy and gatekeep some of the gems from becoming chaotic hubs for scams. Feel free to DM or request in the comments again. 



***Finally, try some ros omelette, chicken xacuti, chicken cafreal, kulleo, xinnanneo, feni and urrak when you visit.***

 i will not be posting a list of hidden gems for the mere fact that these do not need to become popular and most goans myself included would not like for these to become popular as they will then attract scams unfortunately tourism and tourists have also shown a tendency to destroy the sanctity and cause chaos but like i said lets avoid the scams too
 that being said i am happy to help with an itinerary on dms but to avoid scams this post will have no itinerary
 if your travel research helps you find the underrated spots and hidden gems do your best to not publicly disclose these locations again to avoid risking attracting scams and to avoid disruptive behaviours
 and for goenkars reading this the peace and sanctity of goa and goans will be protected



so lets start with the obvious how to get to your stays when you arrive first arriving by flight

most travellers arrive in goa via flight weve got two airports gox and goi gox is in the north of the state located in mopa goi in the south in vasco  dabolim

in general once you arrive at either of the airports youve got one of four options to pick for your travel to your stays

 public transport via bus
 taxis at the airport
 taxis prebooked through your hotel  contact at your stays
 taxis booked via goamiles

  
tip number  as much as you can aim to arrive during daylight hours 

youre not going to find a bus for travel from either airport later in the evening or at night¬† in general weve got either the goverment entity kadamba service or private buses operating from the airports but expect the last bus to depart the airport around  to  irrespective of your destination and bear in mind youll probably have to make connections via hubs

the kadamba ktcl bus timings can be found at this page for goi and this page for gox

beyond these timings your only options are taxis

  
tip number  if you do need to use the taxis try to book them via goamiles or ask your hotel or host from your stay to get you a contact and use the goamiles app for an estimate of a cost but bear in mind it will be the cheapest option so other options will be slightly costlier

if you do need to use a taxi or if you wish to try to follow this tip goamiles is official and you will not get scammed whatsoever prebook a taxi if you wish as well main reasons being the airport taxis can be notorious at overcharging you and if youre arriving at night you may be charged more for night charges¬† and also you might find yourself having to deal with taxi mafia if youre going to rely on airport taxis  


tourist trap  taxi mafias  
the so called taxi mafia are easy to identify these guys will probably find you at the arrivals exits and will usually direct you towards the parking areas which is where they park or they will tell you that theyre calling a car the reason the latter is common is because these owners sometimes dont park at the airport due to parking charges

best to avoid this situation by having a local contact given to you by your host or by asking your hotel to book you one or booking your taxi via the goamiles app in these cases the cabs do not go around to the airport parking areas but will pick you up from the arrivals shortstay area particularly at gox where youre going to face less obstruction from the taxi mafia you can also book using the goamiles stands but you may face some obstruction

note goamiles is also more active at goi as theres less disruption of the taxi mafia in the south



what if you dont arrive by flight

travellers who dont arrive by flight usually arrive by rail the biggest rail hub in goa is madgaon junction in margaomadgaon travelling from here is similar you ideally want to catch a bus from the station to margao bus stand and then make your way forward by connections through other hubs

  
tip number  if you arrive at madgaon junction take the bus again and once again aim to arrive during daylight hours 

same reasons as above bus timings only usually go up to 

note the alternative rail stations to arrive include vasco da gama and thivim but the same tip applies bus connections exist but only during daylight hours up to  beyond that follow tip number  for cabs the only difference being youll also have the option of autos



bus hubs and connections

depending on where you arrive your main bus hubs will be mapusa panaji vasco and margao

you have ktcl shuttle services nonstop  direct between the following

 mapusa  panaji
 panaji  margao
 panaji  vasco
 vasco  margao

tip number  get to one of these hubs whichever is closest to your destination for your stay and you will find a bus or connection going to that location again buses only operate during daylight hours last one departing at  or so



about your stays

depending on your preference youll want to stay at hotels or looking at airbnbs but you also have the options of local guest houses and hostels the guesthouses will be your cheapest options and will be owned by true locals youre way less likely to get scammed that way

  
tip number  use local guest houses for stays you can usually find these through airbnb as well or by a local contact some even go as cheap as k a night or less 

the location of your stay is entirely up to you you have cheap options all over but you have to look based on your preference airbnb and bookingcom are the best for this makemytrip not so much

note while most people prefer hotels these are not owned by goans and will generally be more expensive or overcharge

  
tip number  super important as much as you can do not arrive without having a stay booked

i have encountered many visitors come down with no idea of where theyre going to stay they wish to stay at popular locations such as calangute and baga but have nothing booked youre never going to find a last minute off the riff stay if you arrive that way and you will get scammed

there are only a few internationals who know how to properly navigate this approach as they get information of guest houses by word of mouth but if you dont youll fall into another trap

  
tourist trap  commercial stays at popular locations  
if you do arrive and you have no place booked you better have word of mouth or contact with a local owning a guest house or else you will get the deals which are last minute charges



exploring goa

to each their own but make an itinerary while it is really nice to visit popular spots i would definitely advise against indulging in services at these locations for instance you may want to visit calangute or baga beach but as these places have been made popular by influences and internet reviews they have also attracted immigrant businesses and moneygrabbing tourist traps and these are never owned by locals

  
tip number  avoid super commerciallooking businesses at popular locations even if you dont want to avoid visiting the locations themselves

avoid the commercial looking businesses at popular locations at all costs instead visit alternate locations for local shacks or water sports even youll not only get more local authenticity but also cheaper rates from honest locals who would rather give you a good experience i will not post any of these locations here as we dont want them becoming the next calangute or baga so its up to you to do the digging

  
tourist trap  commerciallooking businesses at popular locations  
due to the rise of internet reviews and influences popular locations have attracted outside  immigrant businesses that overcharge and do not deliver authenticity these apply to restaurants disguised as local shacks watersports or even certain stalls and local goans do not care about experiences at these locations as they do not own them they will stay away to avoid conflict

do some digging to find alternatives at nonpopular locations and do not publicly make them popular 

  
tip number  rent a bike for navigating goa

these are super useful not only are they super cheap but will also help you avoid hassles in parking or another other roadrelated issues

beware of scams and traps though  


tourist trap  scammy bike or car rentals  
there are some bike or car rental businesses that may charge you for accidental damage or wear take photographs of the bike  car when you receive it and when you drop it off before you hand over the keys some scammers are known to scratch the vehicle with the keys as you go to sign off the return paperwork

  
tip number  find local eateries for authenticity

there are numerous posts on rgoatravel¬† about finding authentic local eateries pubs bakeries and cafes find these and try out the local delicacies most local goan eateries have the absolute cheapest rates even a full meal with dessert and a drink at under  inr you can follow local youtubers too for instance moses is one of the best

honestly i dont need to tell you to be street smart just do some research

  
best times to visit goa

again to each their own however there are a few peak times for tourism the tourism season in goa goes on between november and february  march these months will offer you the most frequency in tourism activities 

irrespective of where you visit in goa costs will go up during december  january for the christmas period it doesnt do well that sunburn and other music festivals  events usually take place at this time either as there is a larger influx of tourists thereby also driving up costs further 

if youre travelling merely for a holiday avoid visiting during the christmas season and stick to the extremeties of the peak tourism season 

the summer will also be super hot and youre less likely to find tourism acitvities if this is what you prefer



behaving in goa

i cannot believe this is a section i am including but i have to since a lot of complaints have been raised about conflict

here are some super important tips about avoiding conflict in goa

 follow driving rules  
i mean i have personally encountered instances such as visitors driving on the wrong side of the street overtaking overspeeding and so on while even some goans indulge in this absolute idiocy most goans are not going to be tolerant of this goa in general is very intolerant to reckless driving

 park away from local communities and beaches  
ffs do not take your cars onto the sand or even remotely close to beaches or communities away from main roads locals generally dislike when the calm atmosphere is disrupted mainly out of fear that the area will turn super popular chaotic and violent so the fear makes them want to retaliate also beaches are not a place to drive sand dune ecosystems in goa are under severe threat of damage and unfortunately one of the major causes is irresponsibly tourists

 do not stereotype goa or goans and do not visit with that mindset oh and also do not liken goa to portrayals in bollywood  
goa is and has always been a mixture of culture tradition and authenticity unfortunately many visitors particularly domestic indian visitors have stereotyped goa as a party place honeymoon destination or clich holiday destination it is neither of those   
  
its a calm getaway destination to relax mingle with local cultures and have an experience and a lot of goans appreciate this more even the clubs and partying scene has only increased due to domestic tourism demand fun fact calangute now has  or so bars whereas back even  years ago that number was probably around   
  
most international tourists couldnt care less about this and in many instances thats why it appears that goans prefer them it isnt the money international tourists spend less than domestic tourists do

 do not make goa what it isnt  
when you come to goa experience it for what it is without trying to make it what it isnt sure preferences are one thing but do not expect your own hometown to be brought here again unfortunately directed at domestic indian visitors there are way too many instances where conflict has occurred when nongoans have tried to make goa what it isnt as it causes a visible decline in local tradition also if you choose to visit an establishment that isnt obviously goan but claims to have goan foods chances are youll get scammed

 interact with locals properly  
every single local in goa will be happy to have a conversation with you and will give you further tips to enjoy your stay if you stay at a local guesthouse some locals might even ask you what rates youre looking at paying and then negotiate do not take advantage of them the minute you try and blow smoke up someones ass or you try to gaslight or take advantage of a local you will be asked to leave the premises and chances are if the group includes immigrants supporting the locals there will be conflict

 ffs pick up your trash  
selfexplanatory

 do not invade privacy stare or ogle

i think ive said enough feel free to dm or comment for specific tips or follow moses   
  
im also more than happy to help out with a specific itinerary but i will heavily reluctant to post all of those here to maintain privacy and gatekeep some of the gems from becoming chaotic hubs for scams feel free to dm or request in the comments again

GoaTravel,Checking out Goa Beaches -- Whats the transport situation like from chennai,"I'll be in Goa for 5 days at the start of April with my wife. We currently booked a spot in Anjuna Beach-- its our first time and we thought we would go where it was most popular.

Is it easy to commute between beaches? We are looking for a little bit of a party atmosphere (maybe for 2 nights or so) but also interested in water sports, hiking, meditation. 

Trying to decide if we should modify our hotel and aim to stay between a few different beaches.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm a solo female traveler in my 30s, planning to explore Goa for 10-15 days. I‚Äôm looking for beaches that aren‚Äôt too crowded‚Äîsomewhere I can unwind and soak in the vibes without the hustle. Also, if you know any budget-friendly yet private stays close to the beach, I‚Äôd love your recommendations!
Please drop your suggestions and let‚Äôs connect!

","If you want silent beaches then you have to visit South Goa | Go to south Goa for peace. In case you want to enjoy some party places then north Goa. 

As you have 10-15 days go to North for 3-4 days near Anjuna, Vagator or Morjim. You will have party places at the same time not much crowded.

Then move to South Goa, Agonda is beautiful and stay near beach. There are many properties with direct access to beach and it will be peaceful. | I would suggest that you split your time between north and south goa.

North: parties
South: relaxation

Zostel is a pretty good and safe alternative to hostels, it's cheap and very much affordable.

Other than that 10-15 days are more than enough to explore Goa.

Go kayaking, water sports or simply party till early mornings.

Now a Flight to KL was 10k one way. We got a really nice 3* hotel stay for 3k a night. We went for same 5 days costing us a total of 55k for flight+rooms. A whopping 30k cheaper. Also grab in Malaysia is miles better than Ola/Uber here let alone taxi mafia in Goa.

It's was very affordable and easy on pockets .Then goa was let loose greed took over . When goa shacks and establishment went from locals to non locals, it lost the differentiating character. Why would anyone visit goa as beaches are the same in karwar gokarna South to  shiroda redi in North ? | Pollution and climate change is killing the beauty of Goa. Add some lousy money hungry people to the mix and the experience becomes unpleasant . People literally feel uncomfortable now, look at the basic connectivity, its not there, people give zero fucks about being friendly.

Bringing back Goa among people's minds is very simple. Make it make sense. Most Indians think a hundred times before spending. Goan tourism needs to understand this. Very simple and easy to understand issue but difficult to implement. Goa was nature gifted .  Laid back beaches privacy , a perfect blend of Portuguese Konkan saraswat food . It's was very affordable and easy on pockets .Then goa was let loose greed took over . When goa shacks and establishment went from locals to non locals, it lost the differentiating character. Why would anyone visit goa as beaches are the same in karwar gokarna South to  shiroda redi in North ? Pollution and climate change is killing the beauty of Goa. Add some lousy money hungry people to the mix and the experience becomes unpleasant . People literally feel uncomfortable now, look at the basic connectivity, its not there, people give zero fucks about being friendly. So far i see it as a good place for pan chewing uncles to gamble on the river and drink cheap beer, other than that ‚Ä¶. Its game over. Tourists have moved on‚Ä¶ Lol, you answered first and then asked questions The overpriced taxis.",1,9,1iyngpz,1740576379,"decline in goa tourism decline in goa tourism i have been reading news articles about decline in goa tourism many people says that flight tickets to goa are costly and hotel accommodations are overpriced and the existence of taxi mafia forced people to stop visiting goa and they ditched goa for international destinations like thailand which are cheaper and better value than goa
 what is the reason behind the decline in goa tourism
 what measures should be taken to boost goa tourism and  revive its lost glory i was one of the people who actually ditched goa for se asian countries last december heres what happened
